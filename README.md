## Hi, I'm Claire

I'm a data enthusiast currently working at a consultancy on a project building a data warehouse in Snowflake and dbt. 

I'm new to dbt and loving it.

I've discovered a few things along the way that I want to make sure that I don't forget!

Thhings I need to write up:

- How to add your dbt documentation to github pages automatically
- How to use dbt snapshots to track changes in your source data
- Dbt guide for analysts
- How to use git with dbt
